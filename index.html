          <p style="margin-right: 5%;">To ensure you that our fragrances are up to the standard we have set ourselves, we have done extensive
            research to prove that the scents are top-shelf.
            Before every season shift, we do an elaborate survey to get an idea of what scents people might <br> be
            interested in wearing. This way, we can ensure that our fragrances are beloved by their audience.
            Also, after a fragrance has come out of our long and intricate production cycle, it is (after extensive testing)
            again surveyed amongst the people to test its popularity.
            If you are interested in reviewing this research, you can look
